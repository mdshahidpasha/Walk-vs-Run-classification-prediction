## 🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying human activity as either **walking** or **running** based on motion sensor data.

Accurate recognition of physical activity is critical for fitness tracking, health monitoring, and smart wearable applications.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Enhance the precision of fitness applications like Fitbit, Strava, and Apple Health.
- Support rehabilitation and gait analysis in medical fields.
- Improve activity tracking in smartwatches and IoT devices.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of motion sensor readings such as:
- Accelerometer data
- Gyroscopic measurements
- Other physical movement indicators during walking and running.

*(You can include dataset source or description link here if public.)*

---

## 🛠️ Project Approach
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning missing values, encoding labels.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding feature distributions, correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Scaling and selecting important features.
- **Model Building:** Trained various ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Naive Bayes
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

---

## 🏆 Results
- Achieved a top accuracy of **XX%** using **[Best Model Name]**.
- Model generalizes well to unseen data.

*(Update XX% and Best Model Name after your final evaluation.)*
